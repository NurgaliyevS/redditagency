## Database Management

Post Content uses MongoDB with Mongoose. Here's how to work with it:

1. **Database Structure**

   The database models are defined in the `models` directory.

2. **Common Database Tasks**

   ```bash
   # Start MongoDB locally
   mongod
   
   # Connect to MongoDB shell
   mongo
   ```

3. **Database Connection**

   Make sure your MongoDB connection string is in `.env`:

   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/redditscheduler
   ```

4. **Troubleshooting**

   - **Connection Issues**: Make sure MongoDB is running
   - **Schema Errors**: Check your model files for errors

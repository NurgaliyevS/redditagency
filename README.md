# Post Content

An Open-Source Reddit Post Scheduler for Best Engagement

## What is Post Content?

Post Content is an open-source tool that helps Reddit users optimize their post timing for maximum engagement. Our goal is to help content creators and marketers reach their target audience at the most effective times.

## Why Post Content?

Most Reddit scheduling tools are either **closed-source**, **expensive**, or **lack advanced features**. Post Content is different:

- ✅ **Open-Source** – Transparent and community-driven development
- 🕒 **Smart Scheduling** - Best posting times
- 🔒 **Privacy Focused** – Your posts, your data. No tracking, no selling, no middlemen.
- ⚙️ **Easy to Use** – Simple and intuitive interface
- 📊 **Analytics** – Track post performance and engagement
- 🚀 **Developer-Friendly** – Built with extensibility in mind

## Tech Stack

Post Content is built with modern and reliable technologies:

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Javascript, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Authentication**: Reddit OAuth
